# Welcome to Automock

**Automock is a TypeScript-based library designed for unit testing applications.**
This is an open-source project that is working toward the goal of bringing improved software quality to the forefront. This will be accomplished by turning the concept of automated testing, particularly unit testing, into a practical library that can be used in TypeScript applications.
