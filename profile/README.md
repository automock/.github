**The purpose of this project is to build useful solutions and utilities that make it possible to adopt software quality standards throughout the development of JavaScript and TypeScript applications. Our goal is to make a bridge between theoretical principles and actual execution so that developers working in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystems will be able to adhere to these ideal techniques in a competent manner.**
